        <p>the setup below is the standard setup for right hand players. Kick, Snare, HighHat are all you need...</p>    
        <img src="./assets/drumslabled.jpg">
    <h1>Cymbals</h1>
        <p>4 cymbal types: High-Hat, Crash, Ride, Splash. Leave a gap between the Highhat cymbals so they're not touching when in rest position. </p>
    <h1>Snare</h1>
        <p>Use the "throw off" switch to turn on and off the snare. The black circle in the center is called the "power dot" or "batter". It's a heaver part that protects the drum from hard hits and adds a different sound. The "Gel Pads / Moongel" is used to dampen the drum and stop the resonating. Put the gel pads near the edge of your cymbal to cut the ringing</p>
    <h1>Accessories</h1>
        <p>Drum Sticks: Most drums sticks have a number and letter. The number is the stick thickness (7 thinnest, 2 thickest, 5 is middle/default). Letter is the tip shape (A "acorn", B "Barrel")<br>
        Rods/Brushes: are much quieter than drumsticks and can be used to soften the sound. Brushes can make sweeping sound for generas like jazz</p>
    <h1>Most common brands</h1>
        <p>Most common brands ranked highest to lowest: (Drum Workshop, Yamaha, Pearl, Ludwig, Tama, Gretsch)</p>

    {title: "MixersüéöÔ∏è", thehtml: `
    <h1>My Advise</h1>
        <p>
        Get digital mixer with combo inputs (takes both XLR and TS/Instrument cables in the same hole). I prefer digital because they're very compact and both analog & digital mixers need power anyway. You can have 32 input small digital mixer with 8 channels because you can change between layers (1-8) (9-16) (17-25) (25-32). Also digital mixers have effects and have "Scribble Strips" that display the channel number, instrument emoji, and name for each channel that you can customize. You can save layouts, have a screen to view EQ, and record with digital mixers.<br>"Interface" is use for recording an instrument, but they're useless now because mixers can record and save music also.</p>   
    <h1>Analog vs Digital</h1>
        <p>
        <b>Analog Mixers</b> have control knobs for each channel/column<br>
        <b>Digital Mixers</b> have one section for EQ, Gain, Compressor, Pan... for all channels. You select one channel at a time to control. Each Section has a on/off button and a View button to show section (EQ, Pan...) on the big screen. Each channel has a select button, fader, mute, and a mini Display with channel name, number, and custom emojis like guitar/keyboard.<br>
        <b>Scenes:</b> Save all setting, faders, everything as a scene. You can save/load scenes to quickly have your setup. Digital mixers have a scene section on the board, click the view button to see/load your scenes. 
        </p>
    <h1>EQ</h1>
        <p>
            <b>High</b>(bright/airy/tinny), <b>Mid</b>(warm/clear), <b>Low</b>(bassy/deep/thumping)<br>
            Gain Knob: turn up/down volume on the selected frequency<br>
            Freq Knob: fine tuner, move up/down frequency for more control<br>
            Q Knob: How wide/spread across frequencies to affect. Called "quality factor"
        </p>
    <h1>Other Processors</h1>
        <p>
        <b>Gain Volume:</b> Incoming signal volume. Boost/Reduce volume to get in the middle/yellow zone<br>
        <b>Fader Volume:</b> Volume sliders at the bottom, the channel volume, try to be aroun 0db which is usually marked 3/4ths the way up on slider scale<br>
        <b>Main Volume:</b> Volume for everything<br>
        <b>Mute:</b> Quickly mute channel without moving with your faders setup<br>
        <b>Gate:</b> Removes all sound that is quieter that a given threshold<br>
        <b>Compressor/Dynamics:</b> Makes volume stay evenly loud. Treshold lowers volume if volume goes over it. Can use for vocals, drums... to reduce loudness changes. If drummer is hitting hard or soft the volume will be closer<br>
        <b>LowCut / HPF:</b> button that removes very low freq. like the annoying rumble from handling mics or the stage rumble from unnecessary low frequences. Turn LowCut on to reduce very low bassyness.<br>
        <b>√ò:</b> Invert audio signal<br>
        <b>PhantomPower/+48v:</b> only used to condenser mics which are in studios, dynamic/stage mics don't need it<br>
        <b>Solo/PFL:</b> Isolates a channel to hear for testing.  1) "Solo in Place (SIP)" Mutes all other channels execpt the channel you just pressed. OR "Prefader Listening (PFL)" No channels mute, but all solo activated channels output to headphone jack so you can listen to it isolated) "AfterFader Listening(AFL)"<br>
        <b>FX:</b> add effect volume to channel for whatever the current effect is<br>
        <b>PAN:</b> how much is on left & right speaker. If paned all the way left, 100% channel volume is on left speaker. Paned middle (default) comes out 50/50 both L and R outputs/speakers<br>
        <b>PAD/26dB:</b> Reduces input gain by 26dB if input loud with little gain / peaking <br>
        </p>
    <h1>All Main Effects</h1>
        <p>
        Reverb: (room, hall, stage) <br>
        Echo/Delay: Repeated sound after you play<br>
        Distortion: overdrive(clean, powerful, tube amp) (dirty)<br>
        Chorus/Flanger: doubles sound like 2 instruments playing, one slightly out of tune. Phaser(adds slo auto wawa)<br>
        Tremelo: Volume Pulsating <br>
        Wah: wa/waw funky sound<br>
        Pitch Shift: plays another note that harmonizes with you <br>
        Ocataver: Raise/Lower pitch
        </p>
    <h1>How to Mix</h1>
        <p>1) Mute everything, faders down<br>
        2) Plug in all instruments/mics<br>
        3) raise fader to 0db (usually a mark 3/4 up) with gain lowerd all the way down. Bring up gain slowly until channel signal is in middle while instrument playing. Do for each channel (called Gain Staging). If each channel doesn't have a volume meter, Use the Solo/PFL to change the main meter as the individual channel meter<br>
        4) Mix the EQ, Cut Lows/Highs...</p>
    <h1>Common Problems</h1>
        <p>
        Static/Hissing: Turn off "Phantom Power / +48v". Passive speakers have more static because you send power through cables<br>
        FeedBack: put mics behind speakers or point away, turn down mics and sing closer to them. Make sure mic is dynamic and unidirectional (only picks up sound 1 direction)<br>
        Only 1 Speaker Working: make sure your Pan is in the middle.

    {title: "Speakersüîä", thehtml: `
    <h1>Active</h1>
        <p>Normal speaker, powered and has plugin or battery.</p>
    <h1>Passive</h1>
        <p>Passive does'nt have power source and needs amplifier (annoying because you need an amplifier and be careful with oms not to overpower and damage your speaker). Peak & Continuous power capacity are on the speaker lable and show how much power the speaker can handle.</p>
    <h1>Subwoofer "subs"</h1>
        <p>For the bass and low frequencies, Subwoofer placed low on floor. Low frequencies radiate evenly in all directions unlike mid and high range.</p>
    <h1>Monitor</h1>
        <p>Smaller speaker that faces towards player to hear themself play.</p>
    <h1>What to get?</h1>
        <p>Get an "portable active column" speaker like the "JBL EON MK2". They fold up, the tower is the speaker, and the bottom is the subwoofer all in one! Also 4hr long battery powered charges when pluged in.</p>

    <h1>Stageüé§ & StudioüéôÔ∏è mics</h1>
        <p>Stage/Dynamic mics üé§ are used for live performances because they're durable and reduce feedback. <br> Studio/Condenser mics üéôÔ∏è are used for recording in studios and more sensitive to noise (require Phantom Power from mixer or batteries).</p>
    <h1>Mic Attachments</h1>
        <p>Pop Filter: is a flat mesh object put in front of a mic to reduce the poping puff sound from "p" and "b" usually for studio/condensor mics since they're sensitive. <br>
        Mic Covers & Muffs: are the fuzzy things that block the wind and breath and keep them clean from dust.</p>

    <img src="./assets/cabletypeslabled.jpg">    
    <h1>Cable Types</h1>
        <p>
        <b>XLR:</b> "Mic Cable" usually mics and mixer outputs, very strong and durable connection safe from electric distortion (balanced)<br>
        <b>TS:</b> "instrument cable"<br>
        <b>TRS 1/8in:</b> "Headphone jack"<br>
        <b>RA:</b> stands for Right Angle
        </p>
    <h1>Balanced & Unbalanced</h1>
        <p>Balanced cable is resistant to hissing noise cause by nearby electronics, unbalanced is not. The only time this matters is if you have a very long cable running past electronics, otherwise normal/short cables won't pickup much interference</p>
    <h1>Adapters</h1>
        <p>A little device that converts chord tips. Attach the adapter on the cable tip to convert cable type. Example: TS 1/4 cable attach a TRS 1/8 adapter to the tip of the cable and the cord is now (TS 1/4 to TRS 1/8)</p>
    <h1>Stage Box / Snake Cable</h1>
        <p>
        In big shows, the mixer will be far from stage in the back so a Extension Cable is used to plug in all inputs and bring them to the back<br>
        Snake/AnalogStageBox: An extencion chord for all your inputs. Thick output cord because of multiple cords for each input bundled together<br>
        DigitalStageBox: a box to plug in all inputs with a much smaller output cable than a snake/analog stagebox</p>

    {title: "How to Run a Band", thehtml: `
    <h1>Setup</h1>
    <p>
    1) Start a group chat (FB Messenger). What u calling yourselfs? Where u practicing? Whos plaing what?<br>
    2) SongList: Make a list of all the songs yall know & want to do. 
    Try songs at practice to see if it has potential<br>
    3) SetList: Make a list of your best songs in the order you'll play at gigs so you know exactly what to play<br>
    4) Equipment: 2 Foldable Speakers that includes (speaker, subwoofer, battery...) like the "JBL EON MK2", Mixer(small analog or digital for more inputs), Dynamic Mics, Bag(XLR & Instrument Cables, Tuners, Capos, Picks, drum key)
    </p>
    <h1>Be Sucessful Checklist</h1>
        <p>1) Personalities: you need people you can trust. If you have talented musicians, it doesn't matter if someone is controlling/close minded/drama/arguing. You need nice/openminded people. You shouldn't be afraid to share feedback. <br>
        2) Same goals?: is everone excided about playing, or are they just kind of there. Don't be too controlling alow others to give feedback<br> 
        3) Drugs: its fine to hang with friends and drink & smoke, but if you want to improve it's best to actually practice.</p>
    <h1>How to Practice</h1>
        <p>1) Stop playing songs your already good at: its fun to just play the songs yall have down already, but then your not improving anything.<br> 
        2) Pick songs before practicing so your prepared. either message or talk about it</p>
    <h1>Wise Words</h1>
        <p>People will start jamming then become more serious by making a band. Sometimes the "seriousness" takes the fun away from people instead of jamming. <br>
        Pay attention to others when playing (signals when ending, changing, singing), don't be in your own bubble<br> 
        BE DIFFERENT: if you start a generic metal band and theres 20 others in the area, why would they choose you over all the others?? Look into different genres, same shirts/hats, or something that makes you stand out<br>
        Drums + Bass are your foundation in american music</p>
    <h1>Band Tiers</h1>
        <p>
        <b>(I)</b> "Jammin buddies". Some guys that get together and play some songs, not much structure<br>
        <b>(II)</b> "Gigging". Plays gigs for small crowds. Has a list of songs and comfortable playing for small crowds<br>
        <b>(III)</b> "Has Followers". Has a well-rehearsed SetList/SongOrder that can take anywhere to put on a show and play in front on 100+ people. Actually sounds good, people show up to see them whether that be a few or lots. Can preform up to 4hrs (with break). Loud enough for big crowds (have equipment, mixer, speakers) don't be obnoxiously loud, but enough to cover a big area. Usually at least 2 people singing to harmonize *makes a big difference<br>
        <b>(IIII)</b> "SemiFamous". Performs at large concerts, big following. Goes on tour around the country (Stick Figure)<br>
        <b>(V)</b> "Famous" Can travel internationally (The Beatles, GipsyKings, Rolling Stones, Buddy Guy, BBKing)
        </p>
    <h1>Good Qualities to Have</h1>
        <p>
            1) No drama, hard to get into arguments<br>
            2) Open Minded, willing to take advice and try new things. Step out comfort zone otherwise you wont progress/change. Takes years for some people and thats ok<br>
            3) Learns Quick, older individuals can have trouble learning, even with tasks that seem very simple

    <p>Use "fingerpicking" (index and middle fingers) to play bass, don't use a pick. Your fingertips will harden over a week or 2 and it won't be painful anymore. Use pinky for 3rd fret instead of ring finger (it'll come in handy for poping and muting)</p>
