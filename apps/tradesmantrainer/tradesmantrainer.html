    *Level, Tamper or WoodPlank to flatten <br>

    2) Lay weed barrier fabric <br>
    3) Sand layer then flaten & level out<br>
    4) Place tiles on sand, leave gap between to fill with sand<br>
    Make sure tiles are level and same height as other slabs<br>

        (4) 2nd Layer: paint wall again exact same way when 1st layer is dry (most people paint 2 layers for better quality)<br><br>
        Crown Molding: covers corners of walls for decoration<br>
        Fill in Gaps by using "Expanding Foam" easily<br>
        Hole Repair: small holes use PuttyKnife & Spackling Paste. For Big holes cut the hole out into a bigger square, buy drywall board and cut it a bit smaller than the square hole but leave tape on, apply Spackling Paste over hole and put cutdrywall board over hole and apply more Spackling paste on top<br>

        Bare Floor Types: concrete, hardwood<br><br>
        Before doing make sure your at bare floor (tackstrips are removed unless you want carpet) Also remove any mortarspots sticking out with scraper and vacuum<br><br>
        <b>Carpet:</b> TackStrips (nails angled at wall). Padding layer staple down, don't cover TackStrips. Can cut into many pieces doesn't matter because no one will see it. -> Carpet is in 1 piece bigger than floor, spread it out and cut (Leave access space don't undercut) cutout holes for airvents<br><br>
        <b>Vinyl:</b> Layout the FloorTileUnderlayment (no nailing required) -> Place vinyl boards ontop (boards click together, use TappingBlock/PullBar & Mallet) Vinyl can look like wood & stone, can also cut easy to remove, push into tackstrips and push carpet edge down<br><br>
        <b>VinylTiles:</b> Flooring Primer (let fully dry) -> Place Tiles <br><br>
        <b>Tile:</b> Thinset -> place tiles use "tile spacers" to space even<br><br>
        
        Shoe Molding: covers up floor corners, usually nailed into wall</p>
